### Welcome 👋

I am Frederic, a Full-Stack-Developer from Germany!

Nearly all of my projects are based on 🔥 LARAVEL

Some examples:
- MovieTracker
- Gamelogs | www.gamelogs.de
- LoLCounter | www.lolcounter.fragxz.de


I also made some fun stuff with 🐍 Python - like the miniOCR or Quiz Solver, which can solve Quizzes in Real-Time!
