### Welcome 👋

I am Frederic, a Full-Stack-Developer from Germany!

Nearly all of my projects are based on 🔥 LARAVEL

Some examples:
- [TwitchStreamManager][https://github.com/fragxz/MovieTracker](https://github.com/fragxz/info_tsm)
- [MovieTracker](https://github.com/fragxz/MovieTracker) | Laravel 8.83.5
- [Gamelogs](https://www.gamelogs.de)
- [LoLCounter](https://lolcounter.fragxz.de)
- and many more secretly developed projects 

I also made some fun stuff with 🐍 Python - like the miniOCR or Quiz Solver, which can solve Quizzes in Real-Time!
