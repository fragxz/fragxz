### Welcome 👋

I am Frederic, a Full-Stack-Developer from Germany!

Nearly all of my projects are based on 🔥 LARAVEL

**Examples:**
- [TwitchStreamManager](https://github.com/fragxz/Twitch-Stream-Manager-Info)
- [Twitch Stream Status Tool](https://github.com/fragxz/TwitchStreamStatusCheck) - integrated with only 3 lines of code!
- Youtube Video Manager
- [MovieTracker](https://github.com/fragxz/MovieTracker)
- [Gamelogs](https://www.gamelogs.de)
- [LoLCounter](https://lolcounter.fragxz.de)
- and **many more secretly developed projects** 

I also made some fun stuff with 🐍 Python - like the miniOCR or Quiz Solver, which can solve Quizzes in Real-Time!
- [QuizSolver](https://github.com/fragxz/QuizSolver)
- [miniOCR](https://github.com/fragxz/miniOCR)
- various workflow optimizing scripts
